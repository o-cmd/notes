Many To Many Realtionships between Tabls

-Many-to-many relationships are the most commonly used table relationships
-A many-to-many relationship exists when one or more items in one table can have a relationship to one or more items in another table
For Eg.
      -Your Order table contains orders placed by multiple customers (who are listed in the Customers table), and a customer may place more than one order
      -Your Products table contains the individual products you sell, which are part of many orders in the Order table
      -One order may include one instance (or more than one instance) of a specific product and/or one instance (or more than one instance) of multiple products.
