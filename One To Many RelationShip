### One to Many Relationship

One-to-Many is the most commonly used relationship among tables. A single record from one table can be linked to zero or more rows in another table.
A one-to-many relationship occurs when one record in table 1 is related to one or more records in table 2
However, one record in table 2 cannot be related to more than one record in table 1

    For Eg. Table1 is Customer and Table 2 is Order. Now 1 customer can have multiple orders so in Order table the Customer1 can be associated
            with multiple Orders.But 1 order can only belong to only one customer
