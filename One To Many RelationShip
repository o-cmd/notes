### One to Many Relationship

One-to-Many is the most commonly used relationship among tables. A single record from one table can be linked to zero or more rows in another table.
A one-to-many relationship occurs when one record in table 1 is related to one or more records in table 2
However, one record in table 2 cannot be related to more than one record in table 1

    For Eg. Table1 is Customer and Table 2 is Order. Now 1 customer can have multiple orders so in Order table the Customer1 can be associated
            with multiple Orders.But 1 order can only belong to only one customer 


                                            CREATE TABLE Customer (
                                            CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                                            FirstName VARCHAR(50),
                                            LastName VARCHAR(50),
                                            Email VARCHAR(100),
                                            Phone VARCHAR(20)
                                        )
                                        
                                        CREATE TABLE Orders (
                                            OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                                            OrderDate varchar(100),
                                            TotalAmount MONEY,
                                            CustomerID INT
                                        )

            # Adding Foreign key constraint in Orders Table by taking CustomerId as reference from the customer table.
                                        ALTER TABLE Orders
                                        ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Order_Customer
                                        FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID)
                                        REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
