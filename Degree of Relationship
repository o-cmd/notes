Cardialinity is how the entities are connected to each other (Relationship)

#1. One to One Relationship(O-O)
    Two entities are associated with each other only with 1(one) relation
    Eg.One emplyee can have only one department
        -Here Employee is an entity and Department is an Entity and they are connected with each othe by One to One Relationship.
        -In employee table we will give Emp_id as PK and in Department table we will give Dept_id as primary key
        -And while creating their relationship table or diagram we will take those primary keys as ForeignKey and then assign one employee to
         one Department.

    For Eg. If we have to create such thing ind Sql then 

                                    CREATE TABLE Person (
                                    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                                    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
                                    LastName VARCHAR(50),
                                    Gender CHAR(1),
                                    DateOfBirth DATE
                                )
                                CREATE TABLE Address (
                                    AddressID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                                    StreetAddress VARCHAR(100),
                                    City VARCHAR(50),
                                    State VARCHAR(50),
                                    ZipCode VARCHAR(10),
                                    PersonID INT
                                )

        #For giving reference of Person table we have to add Foreign key constraint to the second table with the primary key column of First table
                                ALTER TABLE Address
                                ADD CONSTRAINT uq_personid UNIQUE (PersonID);
                                
                                ALTER TABLE Address
                                ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Address_Person
                                FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
                                REFERENCES Person(PersonID)
