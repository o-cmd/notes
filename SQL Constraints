SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
They are used to limit the type of data that can go into tables.
This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table.
They can be column level or table level

#1. NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
#2. UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
#3. PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
#4. FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
#5. CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
#6. DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
